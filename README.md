### BucketList - Android App
Started this project from its inception, developed the requirements and specifications, engineered its architecture and planned iterations with end-to-end testing for each iteration. I have no prior experience working with redux, react-native, firebase and testing tools. However, to meet the project demands, I taught myself these tools and have successfully developed the features for iteration 1 (see details in the Requirements and Specifications document). Complete with unit testing, functional testing, integration testing and regressiong testing, the first iteration is on schedule for timely delivery. 

__Development Environment / Tools__
* Redux-React-Native
* Firebase
* Google Maps / Places / Firebase API
* GitHub Repository

__Summary__

For project details, refer to the Requirements and Specifications document. In a nutshell, this app is developed using redux-react-native and firebase (database). A registerd user can create a bucketlist (things / activities of interest). The app uses google maps and google places api to find the user's activity of interest in nearby vicinity. For example, if a user inputs "Rockclimbing" as a bucketlist item, then the app will find boulder climbing gym and similar facilities near the user's current location. 

In future iterations, we plan on implementing calendar sync where the app will also consider user's availability to make appropriate recommendations.
